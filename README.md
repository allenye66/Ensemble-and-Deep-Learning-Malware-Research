Goal: Use ensemble learning and various models to classify malware into their respective families


Process:

- Extract all file names to classify and group them into their families
- Use Radare2 to disassemble each file and write the opcode sequence onto text files
- Create a large .csv file with all the opcode data
  - in the .csv file, we use the first 1000 opcodes as features for training
- models:
  - random forest
  - adaboost
  - xgboost
  - svm
  - bagged svm
  - lstm
  - cnn
  - bagged hmm
  - knn
  - mlp
  - voting
