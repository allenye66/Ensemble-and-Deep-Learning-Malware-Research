'''
This function takes the observation sequence as input and trains the HMM model with 2 stats and random restarts.
What it returns?: The best model in all restarts.
You can change the number of states by changing value for n_components
'obs_seq'---> This is observation sequence consisting of digits in the range 0 to M-1 where M is no of distinct observation symbol.
This is bit tricky if you plan to train on opcode sequence.
You will have to convert observation seq into sequence of numbers. 
For example "mov, add, sub, mov, mov" should be converted into 0,1,2,0,0. 
Here mapping is mov-->0,add-->1 and so on
Aftr training HMM, 0th column in B matrix represents mov. same for A matrix.
One thing to note here that there should not be any number missing in the observation sequence. i.e. 0,1,3,0,0 is invalid sequence as 2 is not present anywhere.
Be careful when doing mapping.

Also, I have already added code for random restarts here. It is not available out of box in hmmlearn. I will recommend debugging once to understand working.
